# Linear-regression-tf
Building a linear regression model using tensorflow 

## Description
**Linear Regression** - Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.

For this model I have used the titanic dataset available as an official for tensorflow datasets. I used the estimator module in-built in tensorflow to make this model.
